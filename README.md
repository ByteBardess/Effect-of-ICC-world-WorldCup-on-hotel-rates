Developed an Excel-based model to assist Holiday Inn's hotel manager in deciding room pricing during the ICC World Cup, integrating dynamic pricing strategies and demand forecasting.

# Project Report: Developing a Pricing Model for Holiday Inn During ICC World Cup

## Introduction

### Background
The ICC World Cup, particularly the final between India and Sri Lanka in 2011, presented a unique opportunity for hotels to maximize their profits. The Indian Ministry of Tourism introduced a 30% service charge on hotel profits for April 1 and 2 to support the event's expenses. In response, hotels, including the Holiday Inn, considered increasing room rates, balancing potential occupancy against revenue.

### Objective
Develop a dynamic spreadsheet model to assist the Holiday Inn's manager, Hitesh Sharma, in strategizing room and add-on pricing to maximize occupancy and profits during this high-demand period.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis
- Utilized historical data from the 1996 World Cup to establish a baseline for occupancy and pricing, adjusting for 5% annual inflation.
- Analyzed cost structures including rent, salaries, utilities, housekeeping, maintenance, and add-on services.

### Model Development
- Constructed a dynamic pricing model in Excel to simulate various scenarios of room rates and add-on charges.
- Incorporated elasticity of demand into the model to reflect changes in occupancy with varying room rates.

## Model Features

### Dynamic Calculation
- The model responds to changes in room rates and add-on charges, instantly reflecting the impact on the profit margin.

### Documentation
- Detailed documentation within the model includes input and output variables, parameters, performance measures, and formulas.

### Formatting
- Emphasized clean, clear, and structured formatting for ease of use and interpretation.

### Flowchart
- A separate sheet within the model displays a flowchart, illustrating the connection between various variables.

## Results

### Key Findings
- Identified optimal room rates and add-on prices that maximize occupancy and profit while considering the government's 30% earnings cut.
- Demonstrated the elasticity of demand at higher room rates and the varying impact of add-on charges on occupancy.

### Visualizations
- Included charts in the model to visually represent the relationship between room rates, occupancy, and profits.

## Discussion

### Strategic Pricing
- The model offers strategic insights for Hitesh Sharma to adjust pricing dynamically in response to varying occupancy levels and customer demand.

### Limitations
- The model's accuracy is contingent on historical data and assumptions about customer behavior, which may not always predict future trends.

## Conclusion

### Implications for Holiday Inn
- The model provides a valuable tool for Holiday Inn to make informed pricing decisions during high-demand events like the ICC World Cup, balancing occupancy with profitability.

### Recommendations
- Suggest continuous monitoring of occupancy trends and competitor pricing for real-time adjustments to the model.
